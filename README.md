# 2nd Year Synoptic (Group) Project - Water Distribution Software (Read Only Archive)

A 2rd Year University Project where we where given the briefing for the Engineers Without Borders (EWB) digital challenge (2020-2021) to design and develop a software prototype to solve a problem over a few weeks.

## Our solution (Overview) 
We decided to develop a prototype of a system that could be deployed at a water distribution centre to help monitor usage of water and help schedule the distribution of resources during period of high demand, instead of wasting water during low usages

## Considerations and (Basic) Requirements
Whilst developing the prototype with the aim of solving a local problem or aid the local community, the solution had to be contextually aware of the local requirements and the issues and problems they faced in their region.

This meant we had to study the brief to identify core requirements along with any limitations. That way we could design to accommodate the limitations and not compromise the accessibility of our solution.

## Project Limitations
We where limited to Software **ONLY** solution. 

No hardware related solution where permitted for this project as part of the marking.

(This was mostly due to remote learning being carried out due to the COVID-19 Pandemic taking place)

## Resources
- EWB Brief: [PDF](README%20Docs/EcoSwell-Design-Brief-2020-A4.pdf)
- GUI framework: JavaFX
